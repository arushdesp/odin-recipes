# odin-recipes

- Part of the Odin Project. Simple CSS/HTML, my english is still bad though.

## What You Can See and Do
- **Homepage**: Introduction to the site, a fun olive oil tip, and links to all recipes.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe (Greek Salad, Tzatziki, Tirokafteri) has:
  - A title and image
  - Description
  - Ingredients list
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - "Back to Home" link
- **Navigation Bar**: Present on every page for easy movement between home and recipes.
- **Consistent Layout**: All pages share the same modern, clean design.

## Theory & Best Practices Applied
- **Semantic HTML**: Uses `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` for clear structure and accessibility.
- **Accessibility**: All images have descriptive alt text, good color contrast, and keyboard-friendly navigation.
- **Responsive Design**: The site looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Modern CSS**: Clean layout, Google Fonts (Roboto), hover effects, and spacing for readability.
- **Relative Paths**: Ensures the site works on any computer or server.
- **Content Clarity**: Recipes are proofread and instructions are easy to follow.

## How to Use
- Open `index.html` in your browser to start. Or explorer.exe index.html from wsl
- Click any recipe in the navigation bar or homepage to view details.
- Use the navigation bar or "Back to Home" link to move between pages.
